Feature  	          HTTP/1.1      	HTTP/2

Release Year	          1997	        2015

Connection Handling	HTTP/1.1: Persistent connections are optional and achieved through techniques like Keep-Alive.
                        HTTP/2: Multiplexing allows multiple requests and responses on a single connection, eliminating the need for multiple connections.

Data Compression	HTTP/1.1: No built-in support for data compression, leading to larger header sizes.
                        HTTP/2: Employs header compression, reducing the size of headers and optimizing data transfer. 

Header Format	    HTTP/1.1: Headers are sent in plain text.
                        HTTP/2: Uses a binary protocol for headers, reducing overhead and enhancing efficiency.

Concurrency	        HTTP/1.1: Handles one request at a time per connection, leading to head-of-line blocking.
                        HTTP/2: Supports multiplexing, enabling concurrent requests and responses on a single connection, eliminating head-of-line blocking.

Latency           	HTTP/1.1: Higher latency due to multiple round trips for resource loading.
                        HTTP/2: Reduced latency through multiplexing and other optimizations.

Resource Loading	HTTP/1.1: Requires separate connections for each resource, leading to increased overhead.
                        HTTP/2: Connection multiplexing allows the simultaneous exchange of multiple resources over a single connection.

Server Push	        HTTP/1.1: Not supported. Developers need to explicitly request each resource.
                        HTTP/2: Introduces server push, allowing servers to proactively send resources without waiting for explicit requests.	

Binary Protocol	    HTTP/1.1: Plain text protocol.
                        HTTP/2: Binary protocol, improving efficiency in data transfer.
	
Security            HTTP/1.1: Encryption (HTTPS) is optional.
considerations          HTTP/2: Encourages the use of encryption, making it a de facto requirement for most implementations.
